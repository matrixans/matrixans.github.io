# 将要远行

## Descrption

---

以撒将要远行。当以撒的妈妈想要杀死以撒时，以撒决定逃跑。以撒的武器，是他的眼泪。好运的是，以撒获得了一个道具，这个道具
使得以撒可以发射出三滴眼泪。只要以撒拥有至少三滴眼泪时，他就会一次性发射三滴眼泪来战斗（如果不够三滴就不发射）。而如果
他把所有的眼泪都发射完毕（也就是剩余0滴眼泪），以撒就会伤心的死去。假设现在以撒拥有N滴眼泪，（以撒的人生非常悲剧，他常
常哭泣，积攒了许多眼泪，所以N非常大，总之longlong肯定是存不下，但不会超过100位数）如果以撒会伤心的死去，输出God，否则 
输出Issac

这题并不是考高精度

没有思路的同学可以搜索 整除3的特征

> 上题搬运自原eden

## Code

利用好 ``%1d`` 和 ``scanf`` 的返回值，事半功倍

``` c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  int oneDigit = 0, sum = 0;
  while (scanf("%1d", &oneDigit) != 1) {
    sum += oneDigit;
  }
  if (sum % 3 == 0) {
    puts("God");
  } else {
    puts("Issac");
  }
}

```


# Buy Things

## Story

---

> This story is fiction

Cirno(⑨) earned some money by selling ice, so she want to buy something.

She comes to Kourindou, a store selling interesting things.

Suppose that you are the owner of the store, and you know she is ⑨ (means she is not very smart), so you have to tell her how much money she has, after she buys something.

## Problem

---

+ **Input**
  + How much Cirno has.
  + How many items you sell. (1 <= n <= 10)
  + The price of each items.
  + **Note: the number of item starts from `0`, and the max is `9`** (Because it is too difficult for Cirno to count to `10`, she's not smart enough.)
  + Following is some numbers. (Denote it as `cirno_say`)
    + if `cirno_say` is `-1`, it means she will not buy anything and leave.
    + if `cirno_say` is `0-9`, it means the item she wants. Take her money.
    + if `cirno_say` is `10`, it is a very abnormal phenomenon. You think it is an **Ihen(異変)**.

+ **Output**
  + If Cirno buy something and she has enough money, output `You have %d yen now.`. %d means the money she has, now. But if she doesn't have enough money, output `BAKA!` and **end the trade**.
  + If Cirno say `-1`, **end the trade**.
  + If Cirno say `10`, output `Ihen!` and **end the trade**.
  + When you **end the trade**, you should output `Bye.`.

# Pascal's Triangle

## description

---

In mathematics, Pascal's triangle \(which we call it Yang Hui's triangle\[杨辉三角\]\) is a triangular array of the binomial coefficients.  
The Pascal's Triangle has these properties:
1. the top of triangle and the numbers on both of left and right edges are 1.
2. a number can be calculate by adding two numbers above it.

A Pascal's triangle which has five rows:

~~~
          1
          
        1   1
         \ /
      1   2   1
       \ / \ /
    1   3   3   1
     \ / \ / \ /
  1   4   6   4   1

~~~

Now provide your with a number denoted by R (2 <= R <= 32), and your task is printing a Pascal's triangle which has R rows.  
The triangle you print must like the sample given below, have one space between any two numbers, several spaces at the begin and no space at the end of each line.

  1 2 1
 1 3 3 1
1 4 6 4 1

## Hint

---

You can calculate the number of the Rth row, the Cth column (start from 0) in two way

1. sum of the number above:  
    if C = 0 or C = R:
    $$
    N_{(R, C)} = 1
    $$

    otherwise:
    $$
    N_{(R, C)} = N_{(R - 1, C)} + N_{(R - 1, C - 1)}
    $$

2. consider
    $$
    N_{(R, C)} = C^{ R}_C
    $$

The numbers in a triangle with 30 rows aren't not larger than $$2^{31}$$, so `int` is enough.

More detail about Pascal's triangle. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle){:target="_blank"}

## Code

边打印边用递推公式迭代地计算，1 个一维的数组就够了。

``` c
#include <stdio.h>
#define MAXSIZE 32
int main() {
  int row[MAXSIZE] = {0};
  // initialize to 1
  for (int index = 0; index < MAXSIZE; ++index) {
    row[index] = 1;
  }
  // get the number of rows
  int rowNum = 0, prev = 0, cur = 0;
  scanf("%d", &rowNum);
  for (int rowIndex = 0; rowIndex < rowNum; ++rowIndex) {
    // for each row...
    // '    1 3 3 1\n' is divided to three parts

    // first part: '    1'
    printf("%*d", rowNum - rowIndex, 1);

    // second part: ' 3 3'
               // 3 = 1 + 2; 3 = 2 + 1  => N(R,C)=N(R−1,C)+N(R−1,C−1)

    // key: backup the value of N(R−1,C) in advance
    prev = 1;
    for (int timesCount = 1; timesCount < rowIndex;
         ++timesCount, prev = cur) {
                       // key: keep the current value as the N(R−1,C) of the next loop
      // current number
      cur = row[timesCount];
      // N(R,C) = N(R−1,C) + N(R−1,C−1)
      row[timesCount] = prev + cur;
      printf(" %d", row[timesCount]);
    }

    // third part: ' 1', missing on the first row
    if (rowIndex) {
      printf(" 1");
    }
    putchar('\n');
  }
  return 0;
}

```

# Count and Histogram

## Story

---

> **These characters in this story and this story are only fiction.**

+7 dalao got an English passage. His heart has no 波动, and he even wants to publish a problem.

"Let them count the letters in it, hahaha~", he thought.

"How about letting them display a diagram, hhhhhhhhhh", +C said.

## Problem

---

**Input** an **n**-length string **(0 < n <= 400)**, count how many **letters** and **words** in it.

Only `'a'-'z'`,`' '(space)`,`'\n'(new line)` in the string, end with **EOF**.

Regard it as word, if it is some letters serial. For example,

~~~
abc hello
world hhhhhhh nnnnnnnn
some letters together
~~~

There are **8** words.

---

**Output** the statistics like a **Histogram(柱状图)**. For example

~~~
9	                   *
8	                   *
7	                   *
6	                   *
5	   *           *   *
4	   * *         *   *
3	** ****        **  *
2	*********      ** **
1	********************
 	abdefgijlnoprstuwxyW

~~~

~~~
// the real string
"9\t                   *\n"
"8\t                   *\n"
...
"1\t********************\n"
" \tabdefgijlnoprstuwxyW\n"
~~~

### Detail

---

+ x-coordinate
  + the letters, with no space between each other and they should be in order
  + if the amount of this letter is `0`, do not show it
  + after the last letter is `W`(Capital W), representing the amount of **words**
+ y-coordinate
  + `1-9`, making it more human-readable
  + to make it separate with the `*` on its right, use `'\t'`
+ diagram
  + use one `*` for one count
  + if there is no `*`, use `' '(space)`
  + no extra line on the top, which means each line has `*` except the last line.

### Sample Input 1

---

~~~
a
~~~

### Sample Output 1

---

~~~
1	**
 	aW

~~~

### Sample Input 2

---

~~~
hello world
~~~

### Sample Output 2

~~~
3	   *    
2	   **  *
1	********
 	dehlorwW

# A Card Game

## Description

---

Xiao Ming is playing an interesting game with computer. In each turn, the computer will give Xiao Ming a series of digits among 0, 3, 5, 7, 9.  
If Xiao Ming can tell the computer the number divisible by 30 as large as possible, which consists of all the digits, he will win.  
Now your task is helping Xiao Ming find out this number if it exists.  
The input contains 2 lines. The first line is the total number of digits n $$(1 \le n \le 10^5)$$ of game. The next line contains n digits among 0, 3, 5, 7, 9.

The output contains one line. If the number exists, print the number. if it doesn't exist print "no such number".

## Sample Input

---

~~~
6
3 5 7 7 3 0

~~~

## Sample output

---

~~~
no such number

## Hint

The first idea in your mind may be sorting the numbers, but it may exceed the time limit since the size of array can be very large.  
You can search for the knowledge about [bucket sort](https://www.google.com.hk/search?q=bucket+sort&oq=bucket+sort){:target="_blank"}
