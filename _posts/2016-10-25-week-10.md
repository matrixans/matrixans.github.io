# Description

---

XiaoMing is a student of BigMount Middle School. One day, he wants to send a very very long message to his friend, Bob. His SIM card is China Mobile. As we all know, the fee of cellphone data plan is very expensive. To save money, he thinks of an idea to shorten the message. He uses a number to indicate how many times of the letter before appears.

For example, he replaces **"aaa"** with **"a3"**. (3 indicates there are three 'a')

After sending the message, he tells Bob the rule. But Bob is a little clumsy. He doesn't know how to decode the message.

Now please help Bob to decode the string he received to get the original message.

## input

---

a string which Bob received, including character and number(**no space**). The number is in [1, 1000]. And the length of the string is less than 100.

## output 

---

the original string
> Note: The number N in the string may be too big, which makes the output too long. So before output, if N > 7, you need to let N = N % 7 + 1

## sample input

---

``` c
a3.3kil2me.h3!23
```

## sample output

---

``` c
aaa...killme.hhh!!!

(23 % 7 + 1 = 3, so we just output three '!')
```

## Code

---

``` c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <ctype.h>
/*
 * 整体思路是用cur获取当前字符，alpha保存先前读到的一个非数字字符，readingNum标志当前是否处于读数字状态。
 * 判断cur是否为数字，
 * 若为数字
 * 则更新num的值,并将readingNum置为1，表明当前处于读取数字的状态
 * 若不为数字，但当前处于读取数字的状态，表明数字读取结束
 * 可以根据num的值输出alpha，并重置num
 * 若不为数字，并且当前不处于读取数字的状态
 * 则将alpha输出，并将值更新为cur
 */
int main() {
    signed char alpha = 0, cur = 0;
    int num = 0, readingNum = 0;
    while (cur = getchar()) {
        if (isdigit(cur)) {
            num *= 10;
            num += cur - '0';
            readingNum = 1;                     //表明当前正在读取数字
        } else if (readingNum) {                //若当前字符不是数字，并处于读取数字状态表明数字读取结束
            if (num > 7) num = num % 7 + 1;
            for (int i = 0; i < num; ++i) {
                printf("%c", alpha);            //输出指定个数的字符
            }
            readingNum = 0;
            num = 0;
            alpha = cur;                        //将当前非数字字符储存
        } else {                                //若当前字符为非数字并且不处于读取数字的状态，则将先前保存的字符输出，保存当前字符
            if (alpha != 0)
                printf("%c", alpha);
            alpha = cur;
        }
        if (cur == '\n')                        //读至结尾
            break;
    }
    printf("\n");
    return 0;
}

```
